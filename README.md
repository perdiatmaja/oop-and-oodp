OOP Concepts
Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concept in Java. OOP have 6 basic concepts, that is:

1. Class
	Blueprint of object that has relationship inside it.
	Example: Class Vehicle has object machine, driver, what make they move.
2. Object
	Form or entity or property but not method.
	Example: example like above.
3. Inheritance
	Child that can have all public or protected properties (property, method).
	Example: Like vehicle has driver, then any class that inheritance it will have driver too like car or bus.
4. Polymorphism
	In java it mean a function that will have multiple implementation.
5. Abstraction
	Hiding internal details and showing  functionality that must implemented is known as abstraction.	
6. Encapsulation
	This is the practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to them via public methods. Itâ€™s a protective barrier 	that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. Actually there are 2 protective barrier that is private and protected. 
	The private one can only be accessed by class itself, but the protected one can be accessed by class itself and the child class.
